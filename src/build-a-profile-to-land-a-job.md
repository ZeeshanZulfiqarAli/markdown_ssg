1. You have 15 seconds to stand out

-   Odds are, IF someone looks at your profile. They'll look for 20-30 seconds.

### What NOT to do

1. Don't do the type...backspace...type thing. Seriously.

-   As a UI element, it's overplayed. And everyone knows you copied the code from somewhere.

2. Don't use a template

-   It's obvious. After a couple weeks of looking at profiles you've seen all the popular templates.
-   It doesn't show off anything about you.

3. If you do use a template, attribute the source

-   [picture of mis-attribution]
-   Maybe I take a deeper dive into a candidate than most hiring managers. But if I see this, I can guarantee you're not getting the job.
-   (that said Brittnay [link] does make some super nice profiles)

4. The logo list is useless too.

-   [logo-list]

5. Links should take me somewhere, NOT scroll down the page
